    Sfax, a beautiful city located in the east of Tunisia, is facing a growing
    waste problem. It's a sad reality that can be seen in many streets and
    neighborhoods of the city, where trash cans overflow with garbage, and
    litter is scattered all around the sidewalks. The lack of efficient waste
    management practices and infrastructure is the main cause of this problem.
    The streets of Sfax suffer from a chronic lack of waste bins, and those that
    exist are often small and inadequate. This leads to an overflow of waste,
    which is not only unsightly but also a health hazard for the citizens.
    People often discard their trash on the side of the roads, in empty lots or
    abandoned buildings, contributing to the accumulation of waste in the
    streets. Another issue is the inefficient waste collection system, which
    often leaves garbage uncollected for days, contributing to the unsanitary
    conditions in the streets. The government needs to invest in more efficient
    waste collection methods and increase the frequency of waste collection to
    keep the streets clean and healthy.

      The 12 TND Capteur De Poids 50Kg is a cost-effective sensor that can be
      used to monitor the weight of trash cans. By installing these sensors in
      the cans, we can track the amount of waste generated in real-time and
      optimize waste collection schedules. The cost of the project will depend
      on the number of cans that need to be equipped with sensors, but using
      these sensors can ultimately save money. Overall, investing in these
      sensors can lead to more efficient waste management and a cleaner
      environment.

  <li class="lead">
    To collect data on waste management, we have installed sensors in trash cans
    that can detect the level of waste in the bins as well as gather information
    on the zone of the city where the can is located (population, nbr of houses,
    commertial zone or not...). The sensors collect data on a regular basis and
    send it to a central database. Using this data, we can train a
    classification algorithm to predict the likelihood of a trash can being full
    based on various factors such as population, commercial activity, and number
    of houses in the area. This would involve inputting the can ID and the
    relevant data about the zone it is in. The output of the algorithm would
    represent the day of the week that the trash can is likely to be full, with
    a number from 1 to 7 corresponding to the respective days of the week.

    To train the AI model, we will use the collected dataset to create a labeled

    to predict the day of the week when a trash can is likely to be full based

    In this example, we have three trash cans labeled with their respective Can
    ID, along with their location characteristics such as Population, Commercial
    presence and Number of Houses in their area. The dataset also includes the
    number of times each can was full on each day of the week, labeled as Day 1
    to Day 7. This data set can be used to train an AI model to predict the day
    of the week when a given can is likely to be full, based on its location and

      To create the final labeled dataset, we will use the median quartile Q2
      value to determine if a trash can should be emptied on a particular day.
      We will take the dataset that we have already collected, which includes
      information on the population, commercial properties, number of houses,
      and the days of the week that the trash cans were full. Then we will
      calculate the median quartile Q2 value for each day of the week. If the
      level of waste in a trash can is above the Q2 value for a particular day
      of the week, we will label that day with a 1, indicating that the trash
      can should be emptied on that day. If the level of waste is below the Q2
      value, we will label that day with a 0, indicating that the trash can does
      not need to be emptied. This approach will help us to optimize waste
      management and reduce unnecessary trash collection.
